# Architecture Decision Records

An **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)** captures a single architecturally
significant decision: the forces at play, the choice made, and what that
choice commits the team to. One decision, one file, numbered in the order they
were taken.

## Why these exist

Code shows *what* was built. Tests show that it works. Neither shows **why**
the obvious alternative was rejected — and that is the expensive knowledge to
lose.

Concretely, in this repository: nothing in `internal/domain/task/task.go`
explains why there is a lease rather than a database row lock, or why
`ExpireLeaseIfDue` is called before the already-claimed check inside `Claim`.
Both are load-bearing decisions with real alternatives, and both look like
arbitrary style choices to anyone reading the code cold. An ADR is the
cheapest possible place to put that reasoning: next to the code, in version
control, dated, and immutable once accepted.

The ADRs here are **reconstructed from decisions actually made in this
repository** — visible in `CLAUDE.md`, `TASKS.md`, `INTEGRATION.md`, the CI
workflow and the git history. They are not generic best-practice essays.

## The template

These records use [Michael Nygard's
template](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions),
the de facto standard, with five sections:

```markdown
# NNNN. Title in the imperative

## Status
Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-NNNN

## Context
The forces at play: technical, business, operational. Written in
value-neutral language — what is true, not what we want to do about it.

## Decision
The response to those forces, stated in the active voice:
"We will …"

## Consequences
What becomes easier and what becomes harder as a result. Both.
An ADR with only positive consequences is not describing a real decision.
```

Two properties make the format work, and are worth preserving:

- **The Context section is neutral.** If it argues for the decision, it has
  stopped describing the problem and started selling the solution — and a
  future reader can no longer tell whether the reasoning still holds.
- **The Consequences section is honest about costs.** Every decision here has
  a "what becomes harder" paragraph. Pull dispatch gave up global
  optimisation; leases gave up immediate detection of an abandoned claim.
  Recording that is the point.

## Lifecycle

ADRs are **immutable once accepted**. A decision that changes is not edited —
a new ADR supersedes it, and the old one's status becomes
`Superseded by ADR-NNNN`. The record of what was believed, and when, is as
valuable as the current answer.

## Proposing a new one

1. Copy the template above into `docs/docs/adr/NNNN-short-kebab-title.md`,
   taking the next free number.
2. Set the status to `Proposed` and open a PR.
3. Discuss in review. If the decision changes shape, edit the PR — the
   immutability rule starts at acceptance, not at drafting.
4. On merge, set the status to `Accepted`.
5. Add the file to the ADR list in `docs/sidebars.ts`.

If a decision supersedes an existing one, say so in both files: the new one
gets a "Supersedes ADR-NNNN" line in its Context, the old one gets
`Superseded by ADR-NNNN` in its Status.
