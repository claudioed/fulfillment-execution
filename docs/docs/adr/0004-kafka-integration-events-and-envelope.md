# 4. Kafka for integration events, with a CloudEvents-typed catalogue

## Status

**Accepted**, with a known unresolved gap between the published AsyncAPI
contract and the current publisher — documented in Consequences below rather
than glossed over.

## Context

This service has two integration needs with `wes-work-planning`:

1. **Inbound.** Work Planning releases work continuously (waveless). Each
   released unit must become a `Task` here.
2. **Outbound.** Work Planning needs to know when a released unit is actually
   done, so its own plan-versus-actual is real rather than assumed. The repo's
   integration notes name this the **drum-buffer-rope feedback edge:
   Execution → Orchestration**.

The forces:

- **Contexts must not share aggregates.** The reference model is emphatic: *"No
  shared aggregates across contexts… All cross-context communication is via
  integration events/published APIs — enforce this with an explicit
  Anti-Corruption Layer at each boundary."*
- **Synchronous coupling is wrong for this edge.** If Work Planning called this
  service over HTTP to create a task, a deploy here would stop work release.
  Neither side should be able to take the other down.
- **The platform already had a convention.** Four services already used the same
  flat envelope, `github.com/segmentio/kafka-go`, `KAFKA_BROKERS`, and a shared
  broker at `~/warehouse-systems/docker-compose.kafka.yml`. A fifth format
  would be a fifth thing to learn.
- **Delivery is at-least-once.** Redelivery is routine, not exceptional.
  Creating a duplicate `Task` from a redelivered `WorkReleased` would put
  phantom work on the floor.
- **Consumers need to route without parsing.** A subscriber on a
  multiplexed topic should be able to filter on one attribute.
- **The domain event and the wire payload have different requirements.** The
  domain's `TaskCompleted` carries `TaskId` and `StationId`. Work Planning
  needs a third field, `work_unit_id`, to correlate the completion to what it
  released.

## Decision

**We will integrate over Kafka, publish a documented event catalogue with
CloudEvents-style DDD-coordinate types, and enrich for the wire in the adapter
rather than in the domain.**

### Transport

- `github.com/segmentio/kafka-go` (pure Go, no cgo), brokers from
  `KAFKA_BROKERS` (default `localhost:9092`), against the platform's shared
  broker. This repo's `docker-compose.yml` deliberately defines **only
  Postgres** — a second broker would fragment integration testing.
- Consume `warehouse.work-planning.events`, filtering `event_type ==
  "WorkReleased"`, consumer group `fulfillment-execution`.
- Publish `TaskCompleted` to `warehouse.fulfillment.events`, keyed by task id
  so all events for one task share a partition and preserve order.
- Publisher selection is env-driven — `EVENT_PUBLISHER=log|kafka`, default
  `log` — so tests and local runs need no broker, and no use case knows which
  implementation it received.

### The catalogue and the `type` convention

`apis/asyncapi.yaml` (AsyncAPI 2.6.0) documents **all nine** domain events as
the published catalogue, with each message stating its current publication
status. Event types follow the platform-wide convention:

```
com.warehouse.<subdomain>.<bounded-context>.<entity>.<EventName>
com.warehouse.wes.fulfillment-execution.task.TaskCompleted
```

The DDD coordinates are encoded *in the type string* so a consumer can route
or filter purely on `type` without opening `data` — and so the name itself
says which context owns the fact and which aggregate raised it.

### Anti-Corruption Layer on the inbound edge

The consumer decodes the envelope and extracts three scalars, mapping each into
this context's own vocabulary — `path_id` → `task.Type` (by prefix
convention), `work_unit_id` → `shared.OrderRef`, `cpt` → `shared.CPT`, with
capabilities derived from the type. No upstream struct crosses the boundary,
and it calls the **existing** `CreateTask` use case rather than a parallel one.

### Idempotency as a port

`ports.ProcessedEvents.MarkProcessed(ctx, eventId) (bool, error)` returns
`true` only if this call newly recorded the id, so check-and-record is atomic
rather than a read-then-write race. Postgres backs it with
`processed_events (event_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, processed_at TIMESTAMPTZ)` —
the primary-key constraint *is* the deduplication; the memory adapter uses a
mutex-guarded map.

### Enrichment happens in the adapter

`TaskCompleted` stays thin in the domain. The Kafka publisher looks the task
back up through `ports.TaskRepo` and reads `OrderRef()` to populate
`work_unit_id`. The correlation key exists because a specific downstream needs
it; letting that requirement reshape the domain event would be the tail wagging
the dog. The same repo-lookup-enrichment pattern is used by
`inventory-storage`'s publisher for `ReservationRevoked`, so it is a platform
convention rather than a local improvisation.

## Consequences

### Easier

- **The two contexts deploy independently.** Neither can take the other down;
  Kafka retains messages across a restart.
- **The domain model stays clean.** No integration field was added to any
  aggregate or domain event to serve a consumer's join.
- **Redelivery is safe.** The idempotency test feeds the same `event_id` twice
  and asserts exactly one task exists.
- **The contract is machine-checked.** `apis/asyncapi.yaml` and
  `apis/openapi.yaml` are both linted by Spectral in the `api-lint` CI job.
- **New consumers need no change here.** Anything can subscribe to
  `warehouse.fulfillment.events` and filter on the event type.
- **Local development needs no broker.** The default `log` publisher means
  `go run ./cmd/execution` works with nothing else running.

### Harder

- **The published spec and the wire format have diverged.** This is the real
  outstanding cost and it is worth stating precisely. `apis/asyncapi.yaml`
  specifies a CloudEvents 1.0 structured envelope (`specversion`/`id`/`source`/
  `type`/`subject`/`time`/`datacontenttype`/`data`) on channel
  `warehouse.fulfillment-execution.events`. The publisher today writes the
  older flat platform envelope (`event_id`/`event_type`/`occurred_at`/`source`/
  `data`) to `warehouse.fulfillment.events`, with snake_case payload keys.
  `wes-work-planning` reads *that* shape, so the live integration is correct
  and working — but the document describes where the platform is going, not
  where the code is. Migrating requires both sides to move together, because
  the topic name changes too. Spectral validates the spec's internal
  consistency, not the code's conformance to it, so nothing catches this
  automatically.
- **Only one of nine events is actually published.** The catalogue documents
  the full domain-event set; eight are in-process only. That is honest in the
  spec and on the [Events page](../api-reference/events.md), but a consumer
  reading the catalogue alone could over-estimate what is available.
- **Eventual consistency between contexts.** Work Planning's view of
  completion lags reality by the publish-plus-consume latency. Acceptable
  here, but it is a real property of the design.
- **Enrichment adds a read on the publish path.** Every `TaskCompleted`
  publish does a `TaskRepo.FindById`. Cheap, but it means publishing is no
  longer a pure function of the event.
- **The `path_id` prefix convention is fragile.** `pick-*`/`pack-*`/`slam-*`
  with a `PICK` default means an unrecognised `path_id` silently produces a
  Pick task. Documented as a known simplification in `INTEGRATION.md`, the
  README, and the [Integration contracts](../ecosystem/integration-contracts.md)
  page.
- **No dead-letter queue.** A message that fails to process is logged and the
  loop continues. Because `MarkProcessed` runs *before* `CreateTask`, an event
  whose task creation fails is treated as already-processed on redelivery. A
  production deployment would want a DLQ, or mark-after-success with a
  compensating uniqueness check.
- **In-memory idempotency does not survive restart.** Running with
  `EVENT_PUBLISHER=kafka` but no `DATABASE_URL` gives process-lifetime
  deduplication only.
