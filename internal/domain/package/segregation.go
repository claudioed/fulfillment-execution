// DOT hazard-class segregation, collapsed to the nine parent hazard
// classes.
//
// This is a DELIBERATE, DOCUMENTED duplication of the same matrix
// inventory-storage derives for its own SKU-level segregation concern (see
// that repository's `internal/domain/product` package, branch
// feature/dot-hazard-class-segregation). Bounded contexts do not share Go
// types or tables across repository boundaries — this mirrors the existing,
// already-accepted duplication of TemperatureClass between facility-layout
// and inventory-storage (see fulfillment-execution ADR-0009 and
// inventory-storage ADR-0009's package doc comment on
// internal/domain/product/classification.go). Each side names, derives, and
// tests the concept in its own ubiquitous language; nothing here imports or
// generates from the other repository.
//
// Source: 49 CFR §177.848, "Segregation of hazardous materials" — the
// federal segregation table for hazardous materials in the same transport
// vehicle/storage. The regulation's table is keyed by hazard-class
// DIVISION (1.1, 1.2, 1.3 ... 8), not by the nine parent CLASSES this
// service (and inventory-storage) actually track. Reducing that table to a
// 9x9 class-level boolean incompatibility matrix uses four simplification
// rules, applied uniformly:
//
//  1. Collapse divisions to their parent class. Where two classes' member
//     divisions disagree (e.g. class 2's 2.2 is compatible with class 3 but
//     2.3 is not), the pair is marked incompatible if ANY division pairing
//     in the regulation's table is marked incompatible — the conservative,
//     worst-case collapse. A same-package pack station has no visibility
//     into sub-division detail, so it must not stow a division-level
//     incompatibility optimistically.
//  2. The regulation's table uses two distinct incompatibility markers, "X"
//     (may not be loaded/transported/stored together at all) and "O"
//     (allowed only with a documented ADDITIONAL separation method, e.g. a
//     solid intervening bulkhead). Both collapse to a single boolean
//     "incompatible" here: this service models same-PACKAGE (same
//     container) storage, where the extra separation method a "O" permits
//     in a full transport vehicle has no equivalent — there is no
//     intervening compartment inside one sealed carton.
//  3. Class 1 (Explosives) is treated as maximally restrictive: every pair
//     involving class 1, including class 1 with itself, is incompatible.
//     The regulation's real answer for two class-1 divisions together
//     depends on the separate Compatibility Table for Class 1 materials
//     (49 CFR §177.848(f), compatibility groups A-S) which this
//     class-level boolean matrix does not model at all — so the safe
//     simplification is to never permit two hazmat-classified items to
//     share a package if either carries class 1.
//  4. Class 9 (Miscellaneous dangerous goods) does not appear as a row/
//     column in 49 CFR §177.848's table at all — Class 9 materials are
//     generally exempt from the segregation requirements the table
//     enforces. This matrix therefore treats class 9 as broadly
//     compatible with every other class EXCEPT class 1, consistent with
//     rule 3's "class 1 is maximally restrictive" being the one exception
//     that overrides "class 9 is otherwise unconstrained."
//
// IMPORTANT: this matrix was derived independently in this repository, not
// copied from inventory-storage's parallel branch (which may not have
// merged yet at the time this was written). The two matrices are derived
// from the same regulation and the same four rules and are EXPECTED to be
// identical, but they have not been mechanically diffed against each
// other — see this feature's PR description for the reconciliation note
// and follow-up.
//
// segregationMatrix[a][b] is true when DOT hazard class a and DOT hazard
// class b (1-indexed, 1..9) may NOT share the same sealed package. The
// array is sized [10][10] so index i means "class i" directly — index 0
// (row and column) is unused zero-value padding, not a class. The matrix
// is symmetric by construction (enforced by the init-time check below);
// out-of-range/zero classes are never looked up — callers must not pass a
// zero/unset class into IsSegregationIncompatible.
