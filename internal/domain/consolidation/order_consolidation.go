// Package consolidation implements OrderConsolidation: a small,
// execution-scoped aggregate that tracks fan-in of an order's required
// lines arriving at Rebin, so a Pack task is only created once every line
// has arrived. It has no visibility outside fulfillment-execution and
// holds no reference to Task — lines are identified by string id only.
//
// This is deliberately NOT a new bounded context: Rebin is a queue at the
// same cadence (seconds, per-task) as Pick/Pack/SLAM, which this context
// already owns as task.Type. The fan-in problem this package solves was
// previously an acknowledged gap in this service's own documentation (see
// business-context/process-paths.md's "OrderConvergence... belongs
// upstream" note) — this package is that fan-in tracker, scoped to
// exactly the lifetime of one order's Rebin-arrival set.
